  PlanetDescription: HD 189733 b is a name of exoplanet that is located at a distance
    of about 60 light years from Earth. The planet was discovered in 2005 and belongs
    to the category of Hot Jupiters. Nitrogen and potassium are the elements that
    make up the atmosphere of this object.
  PlanetLookDescription: This planet has an extremely picturesque and dynamic surface.
    Blue tones dominate here, which may indicate an atmosphere rich in water or gas,
    or perhaps even oceanic areas. Between the blue areas stretch white structures
    that may resemble clouds, and their texture suggests that they may be massive
    storms or dense clouds of water vapor. In addition, subtle orange and gold streaks
    are visible, which could be the effect of the setting sun, producing spectacular
    atmospheric effects. The planet appears to be a place with intense weather conditions
    and is visually very vivid, giving it a unique, almost cosmically artistic character.
