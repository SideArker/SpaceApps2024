  PlanetDescription: "HD 209458 b orbits the star HD 209458 in the constellation
    Pegasus! The atmosphere of HD 209458 b contains hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and
    sodium, but not only. There\u2019s also Water vapor, carbon monoxide, and traces
    of methane. This exoplanet is located approximately 159 light-years away from
    Earth. Did you know, that the exoplanet has been nicknamed \u201EOsiris\u201D
    after the Egyptian god?"
  PlanetLookDescription: This planet has a very simple and minimalist appearance,
    the dominant color being white with a slight bluish-gray tint. The lack of distinct
    surface details suggests that it may be a celestial body covered by ice or having
    a uniform atmosphere, perhaps consisting of dense clouds or haze. The smoothness
    of the surface and lack of color variation may indicate that the planet is shrouded
    in a thick layer of clouds, much like Uranus or Neptune in the Solar System.
    This suggests that it is a cool, calm world with stable but little variation
    in conditions.
