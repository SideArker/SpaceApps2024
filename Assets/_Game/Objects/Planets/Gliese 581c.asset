  PlanetDescription: Gliese 581c - this planet is located in the constellation Libra
    about 20.5 light years (~194 trillion km) from Earth, which astronomically is
    a very short distance! Gliese 581 c's circulation time around the star is 13
    Earth days.
  PlanetLookDescription: This planet has a dark, monochromatic surface with subtle
    swirling patterns and bright reflections, which may suggest intense atmospheric
    phenomena or energy emanating from within. The large bright spot at the top of
    the planet appears to be the result of reflected light, which could mean that
    it is a body with a smooth, reflective surface. The planet looks like it is covered
    in shadow or fog, which could suggest that it is shrouded by a thick atmosphere
    or that it is in the shadow of its parent sun. The entire scene is in tones of
    gray, giving the planet a mysterious, almost ethereal feel.
