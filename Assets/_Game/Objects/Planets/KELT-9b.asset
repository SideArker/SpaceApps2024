  PlanetDescription: "KELT-9b - a giant planet with a mass of about 2.9 times bigger
    than the mass of Jupiter. The planet has really high temperature \u2013 4000\xB0C.

  PlanetLookDescription: This planet has a warm, brownish-red coloration that resembles
    bands of atmospheric gases similar to those seen on Jupiter or Saturn. Wavy,
    rounded forms in the atmosphere suggest intense winds and storms moving across
    its surface. The dominant shades of brown, orange and red may suggest the presence
    of methane or ammonia clouds, which give the planet its distinctive Martian appearance.
    The overall impression is of a gaseous planet with a turbulent atmosphere and
    dynamic weather phenomena that exudes warmth and energy.
