  PlanetLookDescription: This planet has a very smooth and uniform surface, with
    predominantly bright white and bluish tones that may suggest the presence of
    ice or a dense atmosphere composed of gases such as hydrogen or helium. Shadows
    and fuzzy rays of light may indicate cloudiness or changing atmospheric conditions.
    The planet appears to be in the colder part of its system, with ice regions and
    clouds of water vapor dominating.
