  PlanetDescription: 'HAT-P-7b is an exoplanet in Hot Jupiters type. It is located
    at a distance of about 1,000 light years from Earth in the constellation called
    Swan. The planet HAT-P-7b orbits its parent star in just 31 hours. The temperature
    on its diurnal side reaches 2730 K. '
  PlanetLookDescription: This planet has a smooth, creamy yellow surface with pronounced
    swirls and ripples, suggesting dynamic atmospheric phenomena, perhaps winds or
    cloud movements. The bright reflection of light at the top of the image indicates
    a high intensity of illumination, suggesting the proximity of a star or a strong
    light source. The planet's colors, ranging from light beige to darker shades
    of brown, may indicate a surface covered with dust or gases, as in the case of
    gaseous planets such as Venus or Jupiter. The whole gives the impression of a
    hot and dry world with intense atmospheric motions.
